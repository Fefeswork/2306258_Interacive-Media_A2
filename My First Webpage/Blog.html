      McLuhan in a way foreshadowed the evolution of media in a way, considering
      there was little to no technology during his time and content was spread
      through writing and not so much technology. It makes me wonder if people
      did know that technology would advance over time. After investigating to
      comparison McLuhan makes between a lightbulb and medium, I then started
      thinking about being stranded on an island. As seen on tv the sand on the
      beach seems useless unless you start writing some content that is your
      message which is then read and understood by some who will eventually
      rescue you. One line did stand out to me while reading this: “For the
      “message” of any medium or technology is the change of scale or pace or
      pattern that it introduces into human affairs.” This line, in particular,
      stood out to me because I immediately thought of what a big influence
      social media has on society today. A lot of messages are shared through
      social media, an example is learning a new skincare tip from a social
      media influencer or learning a cheat code for a level you couldn beat in a
      game from a streamer. Social media has also been the instigator for bad
      messages, these bad messages being display fake standard beauty standards
      which lead to people being self-conscious about themselves.

      Reflection on UI and UX What is user interface:<br />
      I think I’ve done a decent job with regards to my UI and UX, I give the
      user an easy and clear structure of how the website functions. I do
      however think I could could expand more on this and consider this more as
      I feel like I was rather designing the webpage for me and not necessarily
      the user. An example of this would be when I was designing the a
      wireframes and the aesthetic of the website: i did consider the user to a
      certain extent but landed up giving in to what looked and felt nice for
      me. the good: I think what I’ve been able to do well is consider the
      accessibility of the website as a wholesale I made sure to choose colour
      schemes that catered to people who may be colour blindness. With the fonts
      i managed to choose fonts that were easy to read to cater to people who
      may not be cognitive disabilities such as dyslexia. My wireframes a east
      to navigate and aren’t to overwhelming to the user. The bad: The overall
      responsiveness of the design isn’t quite polished yet, only certain
      elements respond well to the change in size such as the headers and
      images, however the text on each page does not adjust accordingly which
      messes with the design. I could’ve applied my theory work a little more in
      terms of my design and offering users a better experience. The aesthetic
      doesn’t necessarily match what The content of my website: I focused on
      making it pretty instead of making use of the aesthetic to convey the
      message.

      Born: 2 August 2001 which makes me 20 years old for now <br />
      Raised in Johannesburg alias the ‘city of gold’ <br />
      Interests: Games, creative writing,and taking really long naps. <br />
      Fun facts: I used to speak South African sign language fluently I am
      ambidextrous My name Omphile Ofentse means‘God-given Conqueror’ <br />
      I am a third-year Digital Arts student at the University of Witwatersrand.

      To destress I enjoy playing sports and watching true crime documentaries
      (who doesn’t love those). This website will hopefully showcase the
      prototypes and pieces of work I’ve produced in and out of the school
      environment.
